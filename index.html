          Buchi Emecheta, a pioneering Nigerian novelist, passed away in London in January 2017 at the age of 72. Born
          in
          Nigeria
          in 1944, Emecheta was raised by her mother in Lagos, where she convinced her parents to let her attend school.
          She won a
          scholarship to Methodist Girls’ High School at 10 and left seven years later to marry Sylvester Onwordi, to
          whom
          she had
          been engaged since she was 11. When her husband went to study in London in 1960, Emecheta moved there as well.
          She had
          five children in six years, and her marriage was abusive and loveless. Her husband even burnt the manuscript
          of
          her first novel, The
          Bride Price, which she later reconstructed. Despite these challenges, Emecheta wrote prolifically and became a
          resourceful and successful novelist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emecheta’s work dealt with themes such as gender discrimination, racial and colonial oppression, the
          disempowerment of
          women, and female independence and ingenuity. Her novels featured strong female characters that struggled to
          free
          themselves from the shackles of patriarchal and colonial domination. Emecheta relentlessly attacked the
          male-chauvinist
          notion that women’s main ambition should be to have children and stay at home as properties of their husbands.
          She wrote
          in an uncompromising style determined to give voice to the voiceless and to portray the bleak world to which
          African women were often consigned by
          societal hierarchies. Emecheta’s most famous novel, The Joys of Motherhood, remains a Pan-African classic. The
          book
          portrays the unfulfilled dreams of its heroine, Nnu Ego, and was an urban response to Flora Nwapa’s Efuru,
          which
          was
          published 13 years earlier. Emecheta borrows the title of her classic novel from a question in Efuru,
          responding
          to
          Nwapa’s question of why women
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="right-column">
        <p>the deity despite her never having achieved the “joy of motherhood.” In her novel, Emecheta demolishes this
          idea as a
          myth, based on her own largely joyless experience of motherhood. The novel is an ironic exposition of
          motherhood’s many
          humiliations and unfulfilled expectations, amidst the enormous unacknowledged sacrifices of Nnu Ego. The
          heroine dies a
          lonely and tragic death, abandoned not only by friends but by her seven children.</p>
        <p>Emecheta’s iconoclastic novel sought to shatter the stereotypical, one-dimensional ideal of the pure, heroic
          mother-figure often portrayed in the first generation of African literature. Despite her commitment to gender
          equality,
          Emecheta had her critics, who accused her of stereotyping gender roles and of reverse prejudice in her
          portrayal of male
          characters. Emecheta once controversially said: “I work towards the liberation of women but I’m not a
          feminist. I’m just
          a woman.” She was expressing her discomfort with the alienating, western middle-class feminism that she found
          in Europe that did
          not speak directly to her own lived experiences</p>
        <p>As she later noted, “If I am now a feminist, I am an African feminist.”
          Emecheta was a pioneer in tackling patriarchy, even before an international women’s movement had arisen
          championing a
          new generation of social rights and equality in male-dominated societies. In that sense, she was like another
          pioneer,
          Kenya’s Wangari Maathai, the late Nobel peace laureate and environmental, gender, and human rights activist,
          who also
          left an abusive husband who was uncomfortable with her self-assertion. Emecheta’s legacy has continued to
          inspire young African writers, and her novels remain an important
          part of the African literary canon.</p>
